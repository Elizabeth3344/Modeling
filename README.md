# L-J gas modeling

## Links 
1) Drive with lectures and other useful information: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lnB6Q0DMBYHWbTpmwrhD4JnL5b16c7dH

## Tasks
1) Check basics of modeling (what are interaction potetnials, integraction schemes etc.)
   - you can follow the link in Links 
2) Check what the L-J gas is and what L-J potential is.
3) Check what the Verlet algorithm is.
